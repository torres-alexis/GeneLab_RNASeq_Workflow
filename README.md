# GeneLab RNAseq Consensus Processing Workflow

> GeneLab, part of [NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr), has wrapped each step of the RNASeq consensus processing pipeline ([RCP](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNASeq)), starting with version F, into a Nextflow workflow with validation and verification of output files built in after each step. This repository contains the Nextflow workflow code (NF_RCP) along with instructions for installation and usage starting with NF_RCP version 2.0.2. For previous versions, refer to the table in the GeneLab_Data_Processing repository [workflow documentation](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNASeq/Workflow_Documentation) which lists (and links to) each RCP version and the corresponding workflow code. Exact workflow run info and RCP version used to process specific datasets that have been released are available in the \*nextflow_processing_info.txt file on the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/), which can be found under 'Files' -> 'GeneLab Processed RNA-Seq Files' -> 'Supplemental Materials'.

## General Workflow Information

### Implementation Tools

The current GeneLab RNAseq consensus processing pipelines (RCP) for eukaryotic organisms ([GL-DPPD-7101-G](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md)) and prokaryotic organisms ([GL-DPPD-7115](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7115_Versions/GL-DPPD-7115.md)) are implemented as a single [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) DSL2 workflow that utilizes [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/user-guide/introduction.html) to run all tools in containers. This workflow (NF_RCP) is run using the command line interface (CLI) of any unix-based system. While knowledge of creating workflows in Nextflow is not required to run the workflow as is, [the Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) is a useful resource for users who want to modify and/or extend this workflow. See the [NF_RCP Workflow & Subworkflows](#nf_rcp-workflow--subworkflows) section below for more details on the NF_RCP workflow, including installation and execution information.

For datasets that include ERCC spike-ins, ERCC analysis is implemented as a separate, manual step using a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook running in a [conda](https://conda-forge.org/docs/) environment. See the [ERCC Analysis Workflow](#ercc-analysis-workflow) section below for more information on how to utilize the ERCC Analysis jupyter notebook.

# NF_RCP Workflow & Subworkflows

### NF_RCP Resource Requirements

The table below details the default maximum resource allocations for individual Nextflow processes.

| Mode      | Organism Type         | Default CPU Cores | Default Memory |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `default` | Eukaryotic organisms  | 16                | 72 GB          |
| `microbes`| Prokaryotic organisms | 8                 | 16 GB          |

> **Note:** These per-process resource allocations are defaults. They can be adjusted by modifying `cpus` and `memory`  directives in the configuration files: [`local.config`](workflow_code/conf/local.config) (local execution) and [`slurm.config`](workflow_code/conf/slurm.config) (SLURM clusters).

The NF_RCP workflow is composed of three subworkflows as shown in the workflow diagrams above.
Below is a description of each subworkflow and the additional output files generated that are not already indicated in the [GL-DPPD-7101-G](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md) and [GL-DPPD-7115](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7115_Versions/GL-DPPD-7115.md) pipeline documents:

1. **Analysis Staging Subworkflow**

   - Description:
     - This subworkflow extracts the metadata parameters (e.g. organism, library layout) needed for processing from the OSD/GLDS ISA archive and retrieves the raw reads files hosted on the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).
       > *OSD/GLDS ISA archive*: ISA directory containing Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) metadata files for a respective GLDS dataset - the *ISA.zip file is located under 'Files' -> 'Study Metadata Files' for any GeneLab Data Set (GLDS) in the [OSDR](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).

2. **RNAseq Consensus Pipeline Subworkflow**

   - Description:
     - This subworkflow uses the staged raw data and metadata parameters from the Analysis Staging Subworkflow to generate processed data using either:
       - [Version G of the GeneLab RCP](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md) when the `--mode` parameter is omitted (default)
       - [The GeneLab Prokaryotic RCP](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7115_Versions/GL-DPPD-7115.md) when using `--mode microbes`
       
       The selection impacts the choice of aligner and read counter tools used in the workflow.

3. **V&V Pipeline Subworkflow**

   - Description:
     - This subworkflow performs validation and verification (V&V) on the raw and processed data files in real-time.  It performs a series of checks on the output files generated and flags the results, using the flag codes indicated in the table below, which are outputted as a set of log files. 
     
       **V&V Flags**:

       |Flag Codes|Flag Name|Interpretation|
       |:---------|:--------|:-------------|
       | 20    | GREEN   | Indicates the check passed all validation conditions |
       | 30    | YELLOW  | Indicates the check was flagged for minor issues (e.g. slight outliers) |
       | 50    | RED     | Indicates the check was flagged for moderate issues (e.g. major outliers) |
       | 80    | HALT    | Indicates the check was flagged for severe issues that trigger a processing halt (e.g. missing data) |

5. [Additional Output Files](#5-additional-output-files)  

<br>

---

### 1. Install Nextflow and Singularity 

#### 1a. Install Nextflow

Nextflow can be installed either through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextflow) or as documented on the [Nextflow documentation page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html).

> Note: If you want to install Anaconda, we recommend installing a Miniforge version appropriate for your system, as documented on the [conda-forge website](https://conda-forge.org/download/), where you can find basic binaries for most systems. More detailed miniforge documentation is available in the [miniforge github repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
> 
> Once conda is installed on your system, you can install the latest version of Nextflow by running the following commands:
> 
> ```bash
> conda install -c bioconda nextflow
> nextflow self-update
> ```

<br>

#### 1b. Install Singularity

Singularity is a container platform that allows usage of containerized software. This enables the GeneLab RCP workflow to retrieve and use all software required for processing without the need to install the software directly on the user's system.

We recommend installing Singularity on a system wide level as per the associated [documentation](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.10/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html).

> Note: Singularity is also available through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/singularity).

> Note: Alternatively, Docker can be used in place of Singularity. See the [Docker CE installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

<br>

---

### 2. Download the Workflow Files

All files required for utilizing the NF_RCP GeneLab workflow for processing RNAseq data are in the [workflow_code](workflow_code) directory. To get a 
copy of latest NF_RCP version on to your system, the code can be downloaded as a zip file from the release page then unzipped after downloading by running the following commands: 

```bash
wget https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_RNASeq_Workflow/releases/download/NF_RCP_2.1.1/NF_RCP_2.1.1.zip

unzip NF_RCP_2.1.1.zip
```

<br>

---

### 3. Fetch Singularity Images

Although Nextflow can fetch Singularity images from a url, doing so may cause issues as detailed [here](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/1210).

To avoid this issue, run the following command to fetch the Singularity images prior to running the NF_RCP workflow:
> Note: This command should be run in the location containing the `NF_RCP_2.1.1` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files) above. Depending on your network speed, fetching the images will take ~20 minutes. Approximately 8GB of RAM is needed to download and build the Singularity images.

```bash
bash NF_RCP_2.1.1/bin/prepull_singularity.sh NF_RCP_2.1.1/config/by_docker_image.config
```


Once complete, a `singularity` folder containing the Singularity images will be created. Run the following command to export this folder as a Nextflow configuration environment variable to ensure Nextflow can locate the fetched images:

```bash
export NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$(pwd)/singularity
```

<br>

---

### 4. Run the Workflow

While in the location containing the `NF_RCP_2.1.1` directory that was downloaded in [step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files), you are now able to run the workflow.

Both workflows automatically load reference files and organism-specific gene annotation files from the [GeneLab annotations table](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A_annotations.csv). For organisms not listed in the table or to use alternative reference files, additional workflow parameters can be specified.

 Below are four examples of how to run the NF_RCP workflow:
> Note: Nextflow commands use both single hyphen arguments (e.g. -help) that denote general nextflow arguments and double hyphen arguments (e.g. --reference_version) that denote workflow specific parameters.  Take care to use the proper number of hyphens for each argument.

> Note: To use Docker instead of Singularity, use `-profile docker` in the Nextflow run command. Nextflow will automatically pull images as needed.

> Note: The `-resume` parameter can be used to resume a previously interrupted workflow from where it left off (see [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#modify-and-resume)) or to restart the workflow from a specific point by changing relevant parameters, which will re-execute that process and all downstream affected processes.

<br>

#### 4a. Approach 1: Run the workflow on a GeneLab RNAseq dataset with automatic retrieval of reference fasta and gtf files

```bash
nextflow run NF_RCP_2.1.1/main.nf \ 
   -profile singularity,local \
   --accession OSD-194 
```

> Note: For prokaryotic RNAseq datasets, add the parameter `--mode microbes` to run the workflow using the prokaryotic pipeline ([GL-DPPD-7115](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7115_Versions/GL-DPPD-7115.md)). The default value of this parameter is `default`, which will use the eukaryotic pipeline ([GL-DPPD-7101-G](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md)).

<br>

#### 4b. Approach 2: Run the workflow on a GeneLab RNAseq dataset with custom reference fasta and gtf files

```bash
nextflow run NF_RCP_2.1.1/main.nf \ 
   -profile singularity,local \
   --accession OSD-194 \
   --reference_version 112 \
   --reference_source ensembl \ 
   --reference_fasta <url/or/path/to/fasta> \ 
   --reference_gtf <url/or/path/to/gtf>
```

> Note: The `--reference_source` and `--reference_version` parameters should match the reference source and version number of the reference fasta and gtf files used. 

> Note: For gene annotations in the differential expression output table, see the optional `--gene_annotations_file` parameter described in the [Optional Parameters](#optional-parameters) section.

<br>

#### 4c. Approach 3: Run the workflow on a non-GeneLab dataset using a user-created runsheet with automatic retrieval of reference fasta and gtf files

```bash
nextflow run NF_RCP_2.1.1/main.nf \ 
   -profile singularity,local \
   --runsheet_path </path/to/runsheet> 
```

> Note: Specifications for creating a runsheet manually are described [here](examples/runsheet/README.md).

<br>

#### 4d. Approach 4: Run the workflow on a non-GeneLab dataset using a user-created runsheet with custom reference fasta and gtf files

```bash
nextflow run NF_RCP_2.1.1/main.nf \ 
   -profile singularity \
   --runsheet_path </path/to/runsheet> \
   --reference_version 112 \
   --reference_source ensembl \ 
   --reference_fasta <url/or/path/to/fasta> \ 
   --reference_gtf <url/or/path/to/gtf> 
```
> Note: This approach should be used for organisms not listed in the [GeneLab annotations table](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110_annotations.csv). 

> Note: The `--reference_source` and `--reference_version` parameters should match the reference source and version number of the reference fasta and gtf files used. 

> Note: For gene annotations in the differential expression output table, see the optional `--gene_annotations_file` parameter described in the [Optional Parameters](#optional-parameters) section.

<br>

  * `--dge_filter_min_samples_threshold` - Minimum number of samples where gene must be expressed (type: integer, default: 1)
  
  * `--dge_filter_count_per_sample_threshold` - Multiplier for sample-scaled count threshold (type: number, default: 1)

* **Entry Point Parameters** - Options for starting the workflow from different processing steps:
  >**Note:** When using `--accession` and running the workflow from an intermediate entry point, the workflow downloads the input files from [OSDR](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/) and generates the runsheet containing the required metadata. When using both `--accession` and `--runsheet_path` together, the workflow will validate that the runsheet contains the expected input file columns. See `examples/runsheet/README.md` for runsheet format details.
* `--entry_point` - specifies the workflow entry point (type: string, default: "raw_reads"). Valid options:
  - `raw_reads`: Start from raw FASTQ files (default)

# ERCC Analysis Workflow

## Running ERCC Analysis

1. [Install conda and the ERCC analysis environment](#1-install-conda-and-the-ercc-analysis-environment)
2. [Launch Jupyter environment](#2-launch-jupyter-environment)  
3. [Execute the ERCC Analysis](#3-execute-the-ercc-analysis)
<br>

---

### 1. Install conda and the ERCC analysis environment

We recommend installing a Miniforge version appropriate for your system, as documented on the [conda-forge website](https://conda-forge.org/download/), where you can find basic binaries for most systems. More detailed miniforge documentation is available in the [miniforge github repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

Once conda is installed on your system, create the ercc_analysis conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f NF_RCP_2.1.1/envs/ercc_analysis.yml
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter environment

Create an  working folder for the ERCC Analysis in the main analysis directory created in [Step 4](#4-run-the-workflow) above and copy the jupyter notebook file into it (downloaded in [Step 2](#2-download-the-workflow-files)) and start a local jupyter notebook server.

```bash
# create working directory
mkdir ERCC_Analysis

# copy jupyter notebook from workflow_code folder to new working directory
cp NF_RCP_2.1.1/bin/combined_ercc_analysis.ipynb ERCC_Analysis

# activate the ercc_analysis environment
conda activate ercc_analysis

# start jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook
```
The `jupyter notebook` command will open a page in the default web browser showing a file listing of the folder it was launched from. If the web page does not open automatically, navigate to [http://localhost:8888/tree](http://localhost:8888/tree).

### 3. Execute the ERCC Analysis

Open the combined_ercc_analysis.ipynb notebook found in the ERCC_Analysis folder created above and follow the instructions for running in the analysis in the notebook.

Once the last cell has been executed, export the notebook contents to HTML using the "Save and Export Notebook As" option in the "File" menu.
